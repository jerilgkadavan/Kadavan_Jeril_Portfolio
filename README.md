### Project Outline


The main objective of this project is to provide a detail information about responsive web design. 
It is represented in a simple and understandable manner where people can get a precise knowledge about web design. 
The reason why responsive design got prevalent is that it clearly shows the comparison between 
the internet usage of mobiles and desktop from 2009-2015. 
The design and animation of the website is in such a way that people get attracted to its specific 
features and engage themselves in learning more about the responsive web. 

Tools used during development phase:
- Photoshop
- Adobe Illustrator
- PHP/MySQL
- Gulp.js
- SASS
